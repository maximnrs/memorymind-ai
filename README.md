# MemoryMind AI

MemoryMind AI is a digital memory game where players challenge an intelligent AI opponent. The game combines **classic memory gameplay** with **adaptive AI**, offering an engaging and interactive experience for all skill levels.  

## Features

- **AI Opponent:** Play against an AI that adapts to your skill level.  
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** Four difficulty levels—Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. The AI’s accuracy and decision-making adjust based on the selected level.  
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Flip cards, find matches, and track scores in real-time.  
- **Visual Design:** Colorful, responsive card designs enhance the user experience.  
- **Point System:** Matches are rewarded, creating a competitive edge between the player and AI.  

## Core Concepts

This project integrates key topics in modern software development:

1. **Artificial Intelligence:** The AI opponent uses a memory-based strategy to identify and remember card positions. Its accuracy and decision-making adapt based on difficulty settings.  
2. **Software Engineering:** Modular, clean code structure using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. Utilities, constants, and game logic are separated for maintainability and scalability.  
3. **Interactive Media:** Responsive UI and animated card interactions create a visually appealing and immersive game experience.  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and content of the game.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic, AI implementation, and user interaction.  

## How to Play

1. Select your desired difficulty level.  
2. The AI will start playing alongside you.  
3. Flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs.  
4. Matches earn points for the respective player.  
5. The game ends when all pairs are found—the player with the highest score wins.  

## Future Improvements

- Add more symbols and card designs for larger boards.  
- Implement multiplayer mode for human vs. human gameplay.  
- Introduce advanced AI strategies for expert-level challenges.
